In the following example, we start with a simple prompt and add elements along the way. Follow along with the example using your own email.

## Let's get crafting

> [!NOTE]
> Starting prompt:
>
> _Review this email and make suggestions to improve it._

In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to review an email for improvements_. As you can see though, there isn't much information to start with.

| Element | Example |
| :------ | :------- |
| Basic prompt: <br>Start with a **Goal** | **_Review this email and make suggestions to improve it_**. |
| Good prompt: <br>Add **Context** | Adding **Context** can help Copilot understand the intention for the email and what improvements you want to see.<br><br>"..._to our client and make suggestions to improve its clarity and professionalism_." |
| Better prompt: <br>Specify **Source(s)** | The **Source** for this prompt is assumed to be the email you're writing in Outlook.<br><br>"_...this email_." |
| Best prompt: <br>Set clear **Expectations** | Lastly, adding **Expectations** can help Copilot understand how you want the table to look and sound.<br><br>"_Please suggest changes to the email's subject line, greeting, body text, and closing. Please ensure that the email is concise, free of errors, and uses a professional tone_." |

> [!NOTE]
> **Crafted prompt**:
>
> _Review this email to our client and make suggestions to improve its clarity and professionalism. Please suggest changes to the email's subject line, greeting, body text, and closing. Please ensure that the email is concise, free of errors, and uses a professional tone._

This prompt gives Copilot everything it needs to come up with a good answer, including the **Goal**, **Context**, **Source**, and **Expectations**.
