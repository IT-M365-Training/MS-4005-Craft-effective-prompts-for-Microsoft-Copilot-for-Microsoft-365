Copilot can also step in to make what you have even better. Maybe you're teaching a cooking class and need some slides about making pizza, but it could use some images.  Ask Copilot to “**_Add an image of a chef making pizza dough_**” and Copilot will find the perfect image to make your slide more appealing.

Give it a try with the following prompts and see what Copilot can come up with for you.

## Let's get crafting

> [!NOTE]
> Starting prompt:
>
> _Add new slides to this PowerPoint presentation._

In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to add new slides to a presentation_. However, there's no indication how many slides you want to add or even what topic they should cover.

| Element | Example |
| :------ | :------- |
| Basic prompt: <br>Start with a **Goal** | **_Add new slides to the PowerPoint presentation_**. |
| Good prompt: <br>Add **Context** | Adding **Context** can help Copilot understand what the slides are for and what topic to focus on.<br><br>"..._about our new FY24 products. Please include an overview of each product, key features and benefits, sales figures, and a comparison to similar products in the market_." |
| Better prompt: <br>Specify **Source(s)** | Adding **Sources** can help Copilot where to look for specific information.<br><br>"_Use the product specs and diagrams from [Contoso-Product-Catalog-FY24.docx]_." |
| Best prompt: <br>Set clear **Expectations** | Lastly, adding **Expectations** can help Copilot understand how you want the table organized and written.<br><br>"_Please use a visually appealing format with images of each product and keep the descriptions brief_." |
