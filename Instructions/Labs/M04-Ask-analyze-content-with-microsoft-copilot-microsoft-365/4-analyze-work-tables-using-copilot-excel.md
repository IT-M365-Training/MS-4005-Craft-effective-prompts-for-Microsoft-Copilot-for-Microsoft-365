## Let's get crafting

First, download **_[Fabrikam Q1 marketing campaigns.xlsx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2269124)_** and save the file to your **OneDrive folder** if you haven't yet done so.

Open the spreadsheet in Excel and then open the **Copilot** pane by selecting the Copilot icon in the ribbon's **Home** tab. Enter the prompts below and follow along.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting prompt:
>
> _Explain this formula._

In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to explain an Excel formula._ However, Copilot doesn't know which formula or what you don't understand.

| Element | Example |
| :------ | :------- |
| Basic prompt: <br>Start with a **Goal** | **_Explain this formula._** |
| Good prompt: <br>Add **Context** | Adding **Context** can help Copilot understand what you don't understand about the formula.<br><br>"_We need to understand how it calculates user engagement._" |
| Better prompt: <br>Specify **Source(s)** | The **Source** for this prompt is assumed to be the table we're working with in Excel, but you can get even more specific.<br><br>"_...from column J of the 'Table1' table in the Excel spreadsheet._" |
| Best prompt: <br>Set clear **Expectations** | Lastly, adding **Expectations** can help Copilot understand how you want the formula explained and broken down.<br><br>"_Please provide a step-by-step breakdown of the formula, including its arguments and syntax. Please suggest additional formulas that would be useful to determine return on investment._" |
