Do you have a Microsoft 365 **work** or **school** account with aMicrosoft 365 Copilot license, or even a **personal** Microsoft account that ends with outlook.com, hotmail.com, live.com, or msn.com? Good news, you can follow along using your own account and some sample files and data we'll provide to you. 

> [!NOTE]
> Some experiences are only available to **work** or **school** accounts with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license or Copilot Pro license. Some features within the Outlook web app work with **personal** Microsoft accounts.

## Download sample files

Throughout the rest of the module, we'll craft prompts for Microsoft 365 Copilot that reference these files. Download and save the following files to your **OneDrive folder** and then open them in the appropriate Microsoft 365 app.

## Referencing files

When referencing files from Copilot, you might find that you can't find some files from the suggestions provided to you. This happens sometimes because certain experiences with Copilot only reference files from the Most Recently Used (MRU) list, while others let you browse OneDrive to find your file. Adding them to that list is as easy as opening them up in the appropriate Microsoft 365 app.  Once they've been opened, they should appear in the MRU list.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft 365 Copilot will only work with files saved to OneDrive. If files are stored locally on your PC, you will need to move them to OneDrive to activate Copilot.

As you progress through the module, you'll have an opportunity to try out other prompts against these files and are encouraged to do so to explore and enhance your prompting skills.
