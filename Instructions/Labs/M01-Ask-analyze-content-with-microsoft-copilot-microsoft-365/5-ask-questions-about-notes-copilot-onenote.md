In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to find out which webinar had the most attendees and participation_. However, you could provide even more information so Copilot can generate a useful response.

| Element | Example |
| :------ | :------- |
| Basic prompt: <br>Start with a **Goal** | **_Which webinar had the most attendees and participation?_** |
| Good prompt: <br>Add **Context** | Adding **Context** can help Copilot understand what you need the information for.<br><br>"_...for our quarterly business review._" |
| Better prompt: <br>Specify **Source(s)** | The **Source** for this prompt is assumed to be the notebook in OneNote, but you can get even more specific by referencing specific pages or topics.<br><br>"_Please refer to the attendance data from the notes for the last quarter._" |
| Best prompt: <br>Set clear **Expectations** | Lastly, adding **Expectations** can help Copilot understand how you fine tune your results.<br><br>"_Please calculate the total number of attendees and average participation rate for each webinar. Please identify the webinar with the highest attendance and participation rate and provide a brief summary of its topic and key takeaways._" |
