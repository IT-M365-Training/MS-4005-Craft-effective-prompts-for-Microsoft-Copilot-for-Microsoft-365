In the following example, we turn a basic prompt for Copilot in Word into a well-constructed, contextual prompt that gives you just what you need, in just the way you need it.

## Let's get crafting

First, download **_[Market Analysis Report for Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea.docx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268826)_** and save the file to your **OneDrive folder** if you haven't yet done so.

Open the document in Word and then open the **Copilot** pane by selecting the Copilot icon in the ribbon's **Home** tab. Enter the prompts below and follow along.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting prompt:
>
> _Summarize this Word document._

In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to summarize a Word document._ However, there's no information about why the document needs to be summarized or what the summary is needed for.

| Element | Example |
| :------ | :------- |
| Basic prompt: <br>Start with a **Goal** | **Summarize this Word document.** |
| Good prompt: <br>Add **Context** | Adding **Context** can help Copilot understand the purpose of the summary and tailor the response accordingly.<br><br>"_with a brief overview of the main points to discuss with my team during the tomorrow's Sales meeting._" |
| Better prompt: <br>Specify **Source(s)** | Adding **Sources** can help Copilot understand which document or part needs to be summarized and provide a more accurate response.<br><br>"_...the section on Competitive Analysis..._" |
| Best prompt: <br>Set clear **Expectations** | Lastly, adding **Expectations** can help Copilot understand how to format the summary and what level of detail is required.<br><br>"_Please keep the summary to 5 key points and use simple language._" |
